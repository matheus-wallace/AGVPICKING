# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- [API] **Consolidated `Camera` capability.** `DeviceSession.addCamera(streamConfiguration)` returns a `Camera` that owns the camera hardware resource and exposes its child features — `Camera.stream` — with `Camera.stop()` to detach and `CameraState` (`STARTING`, `STARTED`, `STOPPING`, `STOPPED`) reporting the camera lifecycle. Use `DeviceSession.removeCamera()` to detach.
- [API] **Display `buttonGroup` component.** New `FlexBoxScope.buttonGroup { }` (backed by `ButtonGroupScope.button(...)`) and `ButtonGroupAlignment` enum for laying out button groups within display content.
- [API] `FlexBoxScope.image(bitmap = ...)` for rendering local `Bitmap` images in display content, in addition to remote URL images.
- [API] Display tap/click handling: taps on display components are routed back to the app.
- [API] Crash-reporting opt-out via an `AndroidManifest.xml` `<meta-data>` entry — `<meta-data android:name="com.meta.wearable.mwdat.CRASH_REPORTING_OPT_OUT" android:value="true" />` disables DAT SDK crash reporting.
- Camera Access sample: record video with optional sound-in-video, continuing while the app is backgrounded.

### Changed

- [API] `DatResult` is now emitted as a Java-visible reference type instead of a Kotlin inline value class, so public DAT APIs such as `Wearables.initialize(...)`, `Wearables.createSession(...)`, `Stream.start()`, `Stream.capturePhoto(...)`, `Display.sendContent(...)`, and `MockDeviceKitInterface.pairGlasses(...)` can be found by Java callers under their source names.
- [API] `FlexBoxScope.image(...)` gained a `Bitmap` parameter for local images. This is a binary-breaking change to the `image(...)` signature.
- [API] `ContentScope.flexBox(...)` and `ContentScope.video(...)` no longer return `DisplayComponent`. Compose display trees purely through the builder blocks; the returned reference is no longer useful and has been dropped.
- Camera Access sample rebuilt around the explicit camera lifecycle (start session, start preview, capture or record, stop preview, end session) on a single full-bleed camera screen, consolidating the previous camera samples into one.

### Removed

- [API] `DeviceSession.addStream(...)` and `DeviceSession.removeStream()` — streaming is now reached through the consolidated `Camera`: use `DeviceSession.addCamera()` and access the stream via `Camera.stream` (and `removeCamera()` to detach). `Stream` is now a child of `Camera` and can no longer be added to a session directly.
- [API] Support for opting out of the Device Access Toolkit App Model (DAM). DAM is now always enabled, so the `com.meta.wearable.mwdat.DAM_ENABLED` manifest metadata key is ignored. No action is required; you can delete the `<meta-data .../>` entry from your `AndroidManifest.xml` at your convenience.
- [API] `DisplayComponent` interface. Display trees are now composed purely through builder blocks; the interface is no longer needed. (Ties to the `flexBox`/`video` return-type change under Changed.)
- [API] `VideoScope` and the `ContentScope.video(VideoPlayer) -> VideoScope` builder. Use `ContentScope.video(player) { ... }` (the `Unit`-returning builder form).
- [API] `StreamError.THERMAL_EMERGENCY`, `RegistrationError.INCOMPATIBLE_SDK_LEVEL`, `DisplayError.CAPABILITY_DENIED`, `DeviceSessionError.DEVICE_POWERED_OFF`, and `DeviceSessionError.NOT_INITIALIZED` enum cases.

### Fixed

- `MockDevice` phone-camera stream no longer stops after a few seconds.
- `mwdat-mockdevice` now ships `-dontwarn` ProGuard consumer rules so external Gradle apps that use `mockdevice` without `camera` build successfully under R8 (previously failed with missing-class errors on internal camera/streaming types).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- Meta Glasses support.
- [Feature] **MockDeviceKit multi-glasses support.** `MockDeviceKit.pairGlasses(model)` is a single factory for all supported glasses models, returning `DatResult<MockGlasses, MockDeviceKitError>`, replacing `pairRaybanMeta()`.
  - `GlassesModel` enum (`RAYBAN_META`, `OAKLEY_META_HSTN`, `OAKLEY_META_VANGUARD`, `RAYBAN_META_OPTICS`, `META_GLASSES`).
  - `MockDeviceKitError.NotEnabled` for explicit error handling when MockDeviceKit is not enabled.
- [API] `DeviceType.META_GLASSES` value.
- [API] `StreamState.PAUSED` value for observing a paused camera stream.
- [API] `AutoDeviceSelector.activeDevice()` — returns the currently active `DeviceIdentifier` (parity with `SpecificDeviceSelector.activeDevice()`).
- [API] `Display.clearDisplay()` to clear rendered display content.

### Changed

- [API] Capabilities (`Stream`, `Display`) are now `Closeable` and expose a `stop()` method rather than implementing a `Capability` interface. The `Capability` and `BaseCapability` types are removed; manage capabilities directly through their `DeviceSession`.
- [API] Renamed `MockDisplaylessGlasses` to `MockGlasses` and `MockDisplaylessGlassesServices` to `MockGlassesServices`.

### Fixed

- D8 warnings about "companion object could not be found".
- Play Store warning about unknown language `fb` caused by pseudo-locale resources.

### Removed

- [API] `MockRaybanMeta` interface (use `MockGlasses`).
- [API] `pairRaybanMeta()` (use `pairGlasses(GlassesModel.RAYBAN_META)`).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- [Feature] **Display capability** — `mwdat-display` brings visual experiences to Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, with content rendering (FlexBox, Text, Button, Image, Icon) and MP4 video playback.
  - `Display` interface conforming to `Capability`, accessed via `DeviceSession.addDisplay(config)` / `DeviceSession.removeDisplay()`.
  - `DisplayConfiguration` for configuring a display session, plus typed `DisplayState` and `DisplayError` enums for observing display lifecycle and error handling.
  - `Display.sendContent { ... }` for building UI declaratively. Each call replaces the entire display; content is presented one view at a time with vertical scrolling only.
  - `FlexBoxScope` view builders: `flexBox`, `text`, `icon`, `image`, `button` with `Direction`, `Alignment`, `ButtonStyle`, `CornerRadius`, `IconName`, `IconStyle`, `ImageSize`, `TextColor`, `TextStyle`, `FlexBoxBackground` styling primitives.
  - `VideoPlayer` with `VideoSource.Url`, `VideoCodec.MP4`, plus typed `VideoPlayerState` and `VideoPlayerError` for observation.
- [Feature] **Device Access Toolkit App Model (DAM)** — a new architecture model for the SDK. Apps opt in by declaring `<meta-data android:name="com.meta.wearable.mwdat.DAM_ENABLED" android:value="true" />` in `AndroidManifest.xml`. DAM is required for the new Display capability; both the App Model flow and the older flow continue to be supported for camera functionality on Meta AI glasses.
  - `Wearables.openDATGlassesAppUpdate(activity)`: opens the Meta AI DAT app update destination for the configured app.
- [API] `Wearables.openFirmwareUpdate(activity)`: opens the Meta AI firmware update screen for the connected device.
- [API] `Wearables.getDeviceState(deviceIdentifier)`: returns a `StateFlow<DeviceState>` exposing live device state, including current `ThermalLevel`.
- [API] `Wearables.registrationErrorStream`: returns a `Flow<RegistrationError>` for observing registration errors out-of-band from `RegistrationState`.
- [API] `Wearables.isDevMode`: returns whether the SDK is configured for developer mode.
- [API] `DeviceSession.errors`: `SharedFlow<DeviceSessionError>` for observing session-scoped errors.
- [API] `DeviceState` data class with a `thermalLevel` property exposing per-device thermal status.
- [API] `ThermalLevel` enum exposing per-device thermal state.
- [API] `NavigationError` enum: typed error for the new `Wearables.openFirmwareUpdate` / `openDATGlassesAppUpdate` APIs.
- [API] `DeviceSessionError` (replaces `SessionError`) adds typed cases for thermal, battery, and peak-power conditions: `BATTERY_CRITICAL`, `PEAK_POWER_SHUTDOWN`, `THERMAL_CRITICAL`, `THERMAL_EMERGENCY`. Also adds `DAT_APP_ON_THE_GLASSES_UPDATE_REQUIRED` for surfacing required app updates.
- [API] `StreamError` cases: `BATTERY_LOW`, `CRITICAL_STREAM_ERROR`, `PEAK_POWER_LIMIT`, `THERMAL_EMERGENCY`, `THERMAL_HOT`, `TIMEOUT` for typed handling of streaming failures.
- [API] `DeviceType.isDisplayCapable` and `Device.isDisplayCapable()`: helpers to check whether a device or device type supports a display capability.
- [API] `SpecificDeviceSelector.activeDevice()`: returns the currently active `DeviceIdentifier` for the selector.
- [API] `Stream.errorStream` and `Stream.start()`: `Stream` now exposes a typed error stream and an explicit `start()` method.
- [API] `VideoFrame.isCodecConfig`: indicates whether a frame contains codec configuration data instead of payload video frames. Constructor signature changed to include the new flag.
- [Feature] **Captouch simulation:** `MockDeviceKit` now allows simulating `tap` and `tapAndHold` captouch gestures via the new `MockCaptouchKit` interface, accessible from `MockDisplaylessGlasses.services.captouch`.

### Changed

- [API] **Overhauled session management to make device sessions explicit.** The previously-implicit CoreUX session is now surfaced as `DeviceSession`, which serves as the entry point to interact with a glasses device — capabilities like `Stream` and `Display` are attached to a session via `DeviceSession.addStream(...)` / `addDisplay(...)`, and session state and errors are observed directly on the `DeviceSession` instance rather than via global `Wearables` APIs. This consolidates several renames:
  - `Session` class is now `DeviceSession`. Existing extension functions `addStream(...)` / `removeStream(...)` now take a `DeviceSession` receiver.
  - `SessionError` is now `DeviceSessionError` (with additional cases — see *Added*).
  - `SessionState` is now `DeviceSessionState`. State values are `IDLE`, `STARTING`, `STARTED`, `PAUSED`, `STOPPING`, `STOPPED` for finer lifecycle tracking.
  - `StreamSession` is now `Stream` (interface, conforming to `Capability`).
  - `StreamSessionState` is now `StreamState`.
  - The `Wearables.startStreamSession(...)` factory is removed; create a `DeviceSession` via `Wearables.createSession(...)`, then call `DeviceSession.addStream(config)` (and `removeStream()` to detach).
  - `Wearables.getDeviceSessionState(deviceIdentifier)` removed; observe state directly on the `DeviceSession` instance via `DeviceSession.state`.
- [API] `RegistrationState` reshaped from a sealed class hierarchy (`Available`, `Registered`, `Registering`, `Unavailable`, `Unregistering`) to a plain enum (`AVAILABLE`, `REGISTERED`, `REGISTERING`, `UNAVAILABLE`, `UNREGISTERING`). The previous registration-error payload has been moved to `Wearables.registrationErrorStream`.

### Fixed

- `Wearables.checkPermission()` (via `PermissionsSession`): fixed double-resume crash that could occur when a permission check is completed twice.
- `PermissionsSession`: fixed stale state after Bluetooth reconnection so subsequent permission checks reflect current device state.
- `Stream` (photo capture): added a timeout to photo capture to prevent permanent locking when the capture never completes.
- `MockDeviceKit`: `don()` and `fold()` now maintain consistent device state across cycles.
- `VideoFrame`: fixed buffer lifecycle when surfacing compressed video codec config frames.
- `ACDCRegistrationService`: fixed a leaked `ServiceConnection` during registration.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- Ray-Ban Meta Optics glasses support.
- [Feature] `MockCameraKit` can use the phone camera (front and back) to simulate streaming with `MockCameraKit.setCameraFeed(CameraFacing)`.
- [Feature] `StreamConfiguration.compressVideo` property to enable compressed HEVC video streaming, bypassing decoding. The `VideoFrame.isCompressed` property indicates whether the frame data is compressed.
- [Feature] `MockDeviceKit` now supports configuration to simulate device registration and permissions.
  - `MockDeviceKitConfig` data class to configure `MockDeviceKit` initialization with `initiallyRegistered` and `initialPermissionsGranted` options.
  - `MockPermissions` interface with `set` and `setRequestResult` to simulate permission states in tests.
  - `MockDeviceKitInterface.enable(config)`, `disable`, `isEnabled`, and `permissions` for controlling MockDeviceKit lifecycle and permissions.
- [API] Session-based device management. Device interactions are now scoped to a `Session` with explicit lifecycle control.
  - `Wearables.createSession(deviceSelector)`: Creates a `Session` for a given `DeviceSelector`.
  - `Session` class with `start`, `stop`, state observation via `getState`, and error observation via `getErrors`.
  - `DeviceSessionState` enum with values `IDLE`, `STARTING`, `PAUSED`, `STOPPING`.
  - `SessionError` enum with typed error cases.
  - `Capability` interface for extending sessions with additional features such as camera streaming.
  - Camera streaming exposed as a `Capability`, as new `Stream` interface. Access to it with `Session.addStream(config)` and `Session.removeStream`.
- [API] `MockDisplaylessGlassesServices` interface grouping mock services, accessible via `MockDisplaylessGlasses.services`.

### Changed

- [API] Renamed `DeviceMetadata` data class to `Device`, making it consistent with iOS.
- [API] `DeviceSelector.activeDevice` returns `DeviceIdentifier` directly. `activeDeviceFlow` for the flow-based approach.

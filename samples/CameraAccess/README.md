# Camera Access App

A sample Android application demonstrating integration with Meta Wearables Device Access Toolkit. This app walks the SDK's camera lifecycle as explicit steps — start a session, start the preview, capture or record, stop the preview, end the session — on a single full-bleed camera screen.

## Features

- Connect to Meta AI glasses
- Explicit camera lifecycle: start/end a device session and start/stop the live preview
- Stream the camera feed from the device
- Capture photos
- Record video, with optional sound-in-video
- Keep recording while the app is backgrounded (foreground service)
- Preview and share captured photos and recorded videos
- Open the firmware update flow when required

## Prerequisites

- Android Studio Narwhal (2025.1.1) or newer
- JDK 17 or newer
- Android SDK 36 or newer
- Meta Wearables Device Access Toolkit (included as a dependency)
- A Meta AI glasses device for testing (optional for development)
